Meteorological Inputs
########
To be able to run the hydrologic simulation with Hapi the following meteorological inputs are required

	- rainfall

	- evapotranspiration

	- Temperature

Distributed meteorological data can be obtain from gauge data with some interpolation method or from remote sensing data

Remote Sensing Module
########

The remote sensing module includes two classes to download ECMWF, and CHRIPS data

CHRIPS
########
The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is a quasi-global rainfall data set. As its title suggests it combines data from real-time observing meteorological stations with infra-red data to estimate precipitation. The data set runs from 1981 to the near present.

CHIRPS incorporates 0.05° resolution satellite imagery with in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring

There are two main data sets. The first is quasi-global and covers the whole world from 50°N to 50°S. The second covers Africa and parts of the Middle-East. It covers the area from 40°N to 40°S and from 20°W to 55°E. The global data set has data on a 0.05° grid at monthly, pentad and daily times steps. This is equivalent to 31 km2. The ‘Africa’ data set also includes data at a 0.10° grid at a 6-hour time step.

CHRIPS data are uploaded into a ftp server therefore and can be downloaded through the `CHRIPS` class in the `remotesensing` module

- First import the class from the remotesensing module


		from Hapi.remotesensing import CHIRPS

- Create the object with the following information
	- Period of time (start and end date)
	- Temporal resolution (daily/monthy)
	- Extend (Longitude/Latitude)
	- Path (directory to save the downloaded data)

.. code:: py

	StartDate = '2009-01-01'
	EndDate = '2009-01-10'
	Time = 'daily'
	lat = [4.190755,4.643963]
	lon = [-75.649243,-74.727286]
	Path = "directory to save the data"
	Coello = CHIRPS(StartDate=StartDate, EndDate=EndDate, Time=Time,
    	    	latlim=lat , lonlim=lon, Path=Path)


- Call the `Download` method

.. code:: py

	Coello.Download()

- A Progress bar will appear and be updated with percent of the download

- If the period is long and the Download method can run in parallel, to activate the parallel mode enter the number of cores with the keyword argument `cores`

.. code:: py

	Coello.Download(cores=4)


ECMWF
########
ERA-Interim data set is a global atmospheric reanalysis that is available from 1 January 1979 to 31 August 2019

The ERA-Interim data assimilation and forecast suite produces:
• four analyses per day, at 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC;
• two 10-day forecasts per day, initialized from analyses at 00 and 12 UTC

- Most archived ERA-Interim data can be downloaded from the ECMWF Data Server at  `http://data.ecmwf.int/data <http://data.ecmwf.intdata>`_.

- The ERA-Interim Archive is part of ECMWF’s Meteorological Archive and Retrieval System (MARS), which is accessible to registered users
- The RemoteSensing and the ECMWF classes can retrieve  the data from the ECMWF servers, if you are registered and setup the API Key in your machine


so inorder to be able to use the following code to download ECMWF data you need to
- register and setup your account in the `ECMWF website <https://apps.ecmwf.int/registration/>`_.

-  Install ECMWF key `instruction are here <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+ECMWF+Public+Datasets#AccessECMWFPublicDatasets-key](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+ECMWF+Public+Datasets#AccessECMWFPublicDatasets-key>`_.

- ERA-Interim data set has a lot of meteorological variables which you can download
- You need to provide the name of the variable using the `Variables` object
- `Variables` contains the tame of the variable you need to give to the `ECMWF` object to get and the unit and description

.. code:: py
	from Hapi.remotesensing import Variables
	Vars = Variables('daily')
	Vars.__str__()


For the information about the ECMWF data `https://apps.ecmwf.int/codes/grib/param-db/ <https://apps.ecmwf.int/codes/grib/param-db/>`_.

.. code:: py

	StartDate = '2009-01-01'
	EndDate = '2009-01-10'
	Time = 'daily'
	lat = [4.190755,4.643963]
	lon = [-75.649243,-74.727286]
	Path = "/data/satellite_data/"
	# Temperature, Evapotranspiration
	variables = ['T','E']

	Coello = RS(StartDate=StartDate, EndDate=EndDate, Time=Time,
        latlim=lat , lonlim=lon, Path=Path, Vars=variables)

	Coello.ECMWF(Waitbar=1)
